  # A signed, notarized and stapled installer laying down /Applications/
  # AIHerd.app and /usr/local/bin/aih. No Python: the summarizer LLM runs
  # in-process via llama.cpp, statically linked into `aih`.
  #
  # No postflight xattr dance: installer payloads are not quarantined the way a
  # downloaded archive's contents are, and the .pkg itself carries a stapled
  # notarization ticket, so this validates with no network at all.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Just open AIHerd.app — it starts `aih serve` itself
    (over a Unix socket; no TCP port is taken). To also reach the dashboard
    from a phone/browser, run `aih serve -p 8080` yourself.

    The stable-terminal summarizer needs Apple Silicon with 16 GB or more. On
    first use it downloads the model (~2.5 GB) into
    ~/Library/Application Support/aiherd/models; the dashboard shows the
    download progress on the pane that triggered it.
